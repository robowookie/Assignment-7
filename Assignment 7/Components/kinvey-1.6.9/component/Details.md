###With the Kinvey Client SDK, developers can build apps with a mobile backend faster.

Kinvey provides a fully managed platform, allowing app developers to focus on the user experience.  We offer a complete set of frontend and backend features for all your mobile, tablet, responsive web and smart device apps.

The Kinvey Client SDK allows developers to add important mobile features with just a few lines of code.  These features include:

  * User management
